# Text-Summarization
Text summarization is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to automatically create a shorter version of a longer text document, while retaining its most important information. The goal of text summarization is to reduce the length of a text document while preserving its meaning and essence.

There are two main types of text summarization: extractive summarization and abstractive summarization.

* Extractive summarization involves selecting the most important sentences or phrases from a document and combining them to create a summary. In this approach, the summary is essentially a subset of the original text.

* Abstractive summarization involves generating a new summary that captures the key points of the original text, even if those points are not explicitly stated in the original text. This approach requires a deeper understanding of the text and often involves paraphrasing or rephrasing the original text.

Text summarization can be performed using various techniques, including statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models. Some common methods for extractive summarization include ranking sentences based on their importance, clustering similar sentences together, and using graph-based algorithms. For abstractive summarization, deep learning models like transformer-based language models are often used.

Text summarization has numerous applications, such as creating summaries of news articles, scientific papers, and legal documents. It can help users quickly and efficiently extract the most important information from large volumes of text data.
